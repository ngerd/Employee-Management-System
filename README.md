## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally, or check out the deployed version for a quick demo.

### ✅ Prerequisites  

Before running the Employee Management System locally, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js (v14 or higher)**  
  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser—essential for running both the backend server and managing the frontend build process.  
  👉 [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- **npm or yarn**  
  These are package managers used to install project dependencies and manage scripts for both the frontend and backend. npm comes bundled with Node.js, but you can also install Yarn separately if you prefer it.  
  👉 [Learn more about npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
  👉 [Download Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
